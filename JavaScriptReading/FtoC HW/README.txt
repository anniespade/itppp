### Documentation

I knew that to create variables I would have to type let x = __

I began with ' let f = 99;

And had ' let c = (f - 32) * 5 / 9;

Then I didn't know what to do so I went into chat gpt and it told me this code:

let f = 99;  // Fahrenheit

let c = (f - 32) * 5 / 9;  // Conversion formula

console.log("Celsius:", c);



I didn't know what the last line of text did so I ask Chat gpt and it replied:

The last line of code prints the converted Celsius temperature to the console. It outputs the text "Celsius:" followed by the calculated value of c. This allows you to see the result when running the script in a browser console or a JavaScript runtime environment like Node.js.
