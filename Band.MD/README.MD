[Website Can Be Found Here](https://nickreinert.github.io/)

To begin, the only person who wasn't working on their own website using their github.io was Nick Reinert. Thus, his website was free so we ended up using his github page for the project.

Sarah brought up the requirements and said we should use the sample website as a template and we all agreed. She knew a lot about the HTML and CSS due to her own workings on her website for her final project!

I had coded a bit of my own website and so I showed my classmates and Nick copied the background image code I had for the website background.

body {
  background-image: url("free-nature-images.jpg");
background-size: cover;
background-repeat: no-repeat;
}

h1 {
  color: black;
  text-align: center;
  font-family: "Papyrus";
}

h3 {
  color: black;
  text-align: center;
  font-family: "Papyrus";
}

p {
  font-family: "Papyrus";
  font-size: 20px;
  width: 800px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  text-align: center;
}
img {
  display: block;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
}
header
h1 {
  font-family: "Papyrus";
}
 
There was some issues getting the jpg file to work, but we changed the link to the name of the image in the folder and it worked.

We also ran into an issue before that where the css file didn't work at all and it took us a minute to realized we wrote 'style.css' instead of 'styles.css':
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">

After troubleshooting a bit, we asked what audio recording we should but on the website- I said that it would be cool to have a feild recording on the wilderness (because of backdrop is in nature) Everyone agreed and I got a nature feild recording from splice and airdropped it to Nick.

The next thing we needed was a photo- everyone sent me a photo of themselves and I photoshopped everyone's face onto a group of 4 squirrels.

Next we all wrote bios!

Sarah went first, then Nick, then Malcolm, and then me!

Everyone's performance review:

Nick - Cool! Wrote everything down

Malcolm - Brought some cool ideas for the nature vibe!

Sarah - Brought a lot! Knew a lot about what to do for this project because she's working on her own website project. Knew a lot about using CSS.
