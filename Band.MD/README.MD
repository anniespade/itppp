To begin, the only person who wasn't working on their own website using their github.io was Nick Reinert. Thus, his website was free so we ended up using his github page for the project.

Sarah brought up the requirements and said we should use the sample website as a template and we all agreed. She knew a lot about the HTML and CSS due to her own workings on her website for her final project!

I had coded a bit of my own website and so I showed my classmates and Nick copied the background image code I had for the website background. There was some issues getting the jpg file to work, but eventually we realized the image wasn't loading because we didn't have enough Cashe.

After troubleshooting a bit, we asked what audio recording we should but on teh website- I said that it would be cool to have a feild recording on the wilderness (because of backdrop is in nature) Everyone agreed and I got a nature eild recording from splice and airdropped it to Nick.

The next thing we needed was a photo- everyone sent me a photo of themselves and I photoshopped everyone's face onto a group of 4 squirrels.

Next we all wrote bios!

Sarah went first, then Nick, then Malcolm, and then me!
